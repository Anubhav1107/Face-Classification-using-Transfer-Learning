# Face-Classification-using-Transfer-Learning

The Dataset contains 100 face photos of me and my friend. The lack of photo has caused the training loss and test loss to go high.
The Transfer learning model I used is Resnet 101. 
I tried with and without dropout and the later one proved out to be better. This Project has helped me to gain a better insight of this work
